# Pre-requisite: pip install httpx httpx-sse
# If not installed, this script will fail. I will assume user/environment might need it.
# But for now I'll use standard library or just basic curl simulation concept if httpx is hard.
# Actually, I can use the `core.event_bus` directly since I'm in the same process/environment for a test script 
# (simulating backend consuming itself, or just unit test style).

# But the plan said "CLI Test: Listener script to print events".
# Ideally it connects to localhost:8000/events.
# Since I can't guarantee server is running in this env, I will test the core `event_bus` logic directly.
